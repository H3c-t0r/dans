and 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/TDJ59cGV2X).

We would love to see you there!


## Get Started ðŸš€
Danswer being a fully functional app, relies on several external pieces of software, specifically:
- Postgres
- Vector DB ([Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant))
- Search Engine ([Typesense](https://github.com/typesense/typesense))
- Playwright (only needed if you're planning to use the Web Connector)

This guide provides instructions to set up the Danswer specific services outside of Docker because it's easier for
development purposes but feel free to just use the containers and update with local changes by providing the `--build`
flag.

### Local Set Up
We've tested primarily with Python versions >= 3.11 but the code should work with Python >= 3.9.

This guide skips a few optional features for simplicity, reach out if you need any of these:
- User Authentication feature
- File Connector background job

#### Installing Requirements
We have plans to move to Poetry however it's not a high priority item (does anyone want to take it up?).

For now, we use pip and recommend creating a virtual environment. For convenience here's a command for it:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required python dependencies:
```bash
python install -r danswer/backend/requirements/default.txt
python install -r danswer/backend/requirements/dev.txt
```

Install [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for the frontend.
Once the above is done, navigate to `danswer/web` run:
```bash
npm i
```

Install Playwright (only required for Web Connector)
@Chris this makes no sense but I don't remember, why would the playwright command exist?
```bash
playwright install
```

#### Dependent Docker Containers
Postgres:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p danswer-stack up -d --build relational_db
```

Qdrant:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p danswer-stack up -d --build vector_db
```

Typesense:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p danswer-stack up -d --build search_engine
```
#### Running Danswer
@Chris can you verify this section? I again run most things via IDE so want to know what you think

To start the frontend, navigate to `danswer/web` and run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the backend api server, navigate to `danswer/backend` and run:
```bash
DISABLE_AUTH=True TYPESENSE_API_KEY=local_dev_typesense DYNAMIC_CONFIG_DIR_PATH=. python danswer/main.py
```

To run the background job to check for connector updates and index documents, navigate to `danswer/backend` and run:
```bash
TYPESENSE_API_KEY=local_dev_typesense DYNAMIC_CONFIG_DIR_PATH=. python danswer/main.py
```


### Formatting and Linting
@Chris can you cover the installation and running checks for black and mypy?
I run this stuff from my IDE so let's document your way

### Need Inspiration? ðŸ’¡
We try to keep up our [issues](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/issues) page updated with the latest
feature requests, bugs, other improvements. This would be a great place to start!

Connectors to other tools are also a great place to contribute, the required interfaces are outlined
[here](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/danswer/connectors/interfaces.py)
and many examples can be found under the `danswer/backend/danswer/connectors` directory.

Some other potential areas to consider (in increasing complexity):
1. Vote on or create GitHub Issues for features and connectors so devs know what is in high demand.
2. Improve code quality, documentation, or adding unit test
3. Fix bugs (generally found in GitHub Issues,
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/danswer/shared_invite/zt-1u3h3ke3b-VGh1idW19R8oiNRiKBYv2w)
or  
[Discord](https://discord.gg/TDJ59cGV2X))
4. Improve the core functionalities of search and question-answering
   - NLP is a rapidly advancing space currently, we want to use the latest developments from opensource, academia, etc.
   to make the core functionality as strong as possible.
   - This could include changes to document processing (chunking), search/retrival, GenAI prompts, NLP models, etc.


### Release Process
Danswer follows the semver versioning standard.
A set of Docker containers will be pushed automatically to DockerHub with every tag.
You can see the containers [here](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=danswer%2F).

As pre-1.0 software, even patch releases may contain breaking or non-backwards-compatible changes.
