    # Default Document Sets for this persona, specified as a list of names here.

    # The admin can then use the UI to add new connectors to the document set
    # Example:
    # document_sets:
    #   - "HR Resources"
    #   - "Engineer Onboarding"
    #   - "Benefits"
    document_sets: []
    # Inject a statement at the end of system prompt to inform the LLM of the current date/time
